The Corporate Structure for Blockchain Ventures Challenge

**Teams participating in the Legal Hackers 2018 [Computational Law and Blockchain Festival](https://legalhackers.org/clbfest2018) are encouraged to tackle the The Corporate Structure for Blockchain Ventures Challenge.

# Overview

Blockchain companies are stuck in an awkward position. They are forced to use traditional corporate structures that are not tailored to the decentralized structure of a blockchain network. A Cooperative Corporate Structure must be created where each participant in a blockchain network is able to exercise control of the network. We are hopeful that there is a U.S. Jurisdiction that can accommodate this corporate structure, but international jurisdictions should be taken into consideration as well.

# Team Participation

To register your team project for the Corporate Structure for Blockchain Ventures Challenge, submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/BLIP-CLBF) with the following information: 
* The name of your project and your team name;
* The names of your team members including the GitHub username of at least one member;
* The URL of the GitHub repository where your project will be developed and submitted;
* The URL of the YouTube Channel where your team will submit video if applicable; and
* The name and URL of the Festival Node your team is participating in

# Challenge Fact Pattern

Create a new legal entity using elements from existing structures such as coops, the L3C, Public Benefit Corporations, etc. The entity should allow for a token to exist either as a representation of company shares or as a distributed utility token on a network created by the legal entity. This new legal entity must be versatile and should allow for decentralized ownership. All people who participate on the network will have a stake in the network via tokens created by the original organizers. The new legal entity should also allow for network creators to withhold tokens to “pay” themselves and others who participate in the networks creation. Using the following facts given by a fictional blockchain network, Legalblock Hacknet, create Articles of Incorporation/Organization in line with the new legal entity that you’ve created: 
* Legalblock Hacknet wishes to remain agnostic and does not want to control the network in any cognizable way. The network will be truly decentralized. They only want to create the initial network and guiding principles.
* Legalblock Hacknet wants to create a token that functions on the network as a utility (utility functionality is assumed).
* Legalblock Hacknet wishes to issue tokens to investors in a private sale prior to launching their network either using a SAFT or some other investment vehicle.
* Legalblock Hacknet would like to retain [______] amount of tokens to reward the original organizers of the network and others who have contributed materially to its creation.

# Criteria and Judging

Teams are expected to:

* Pitch their project idea at or before the start of the 2018 CL+B Fest by submitting a paragraph describing the new legal entity under Creative Commons license;
* Present their final project in the form of Articles of Incorporation/Organization for Legalblock Hacknet, as well as a detailed description of the new legal entity being created under Creative Commons license;
* Provide their final project materials (including any slides, video and other media, documentation, working code, etc) through a GitHub repository under an open source license.

Final team projects will be reviewed and rated by a panel of invited judges.  Evaluation criteria will be added to this challenge page after an initial meeting of the judges and prior to the start of the CL+B Festival event.  The top team projects will be determined based on rank order resulting from an aggregate of the ratings by each judge.  The team submitting the top ranked, highest rated project will be invited to present the project in-person at MIT to interested students, faculty and researchers.  

More information on challenge criteria and additional prizes and awards will be added to this challenge page as they are finalized.
